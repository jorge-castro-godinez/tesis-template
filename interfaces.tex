\chapter{Interfacing}

With the the design of approximate accelerators, the next step towards a complete
multicore system leads to the construction of a model that implements a singl
core and an accelerator. By doing this, it become clearer the requirements and
appropriate setting in order to proceed into a larger, multi-core design.
The architectures presented are based on the NIOS II softcore processor, which
consists on a high performance 32 bits design elaborated from a Hardvar
architecture, and it is been optimized for applications on FPGAs, enabling
configuration of several capabilities, at real time, accordingly to performance
needs.
