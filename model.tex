\label{ch:design}

In this chapter, approximate accelerators for three image processing filters:
Laplace, Sobel and Gaussian, are described. For each filter, five approximate
versions are presented, varying their error metrics due to the approximate
arithmetic components used. This chapter is divided in three main sections:
the accelerators designs, experimental setup, and the results of the
characterization in each case. In the first section a depiction of each filter
is provided ranging from the operations needed, circuitry implementation an
kernel specification. Later, the experimental setup is described, which
contains all the information regarding the tools used for the characterization
as well as the procedure followed. A flow diagram is presented,
so the experimental structure is easily delineated and follow all along the
