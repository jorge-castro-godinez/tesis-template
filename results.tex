\section{Exact and approximate accelerators characterization comparisson}

Characteristics of both exact and approximate types, in terms of area, power and execution time.

\section{Behavioral performance for a NIOS and accelerator integration}

Characterization of each system in terms of area, power and timing analysis. Also show the behavior when an application is running, and the writing/reading sequences with the given memory.

\section{Shared resources and data flow}

Display the obtained interaction between the master and slaves set of CPUs, and the accessing for shared components in order to mantain communication and exact data path for each source.

\section{Multicore performance}

Characterization of the complete platform in terms of power, area, and timing analysis. And present the whole application running for the 5 processors and the interaction with shared resources
