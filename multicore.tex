\section{Multi-Core Design}

Once the interface design between a computing core and an accelerator is 
completed and results are gathered, one can proceed with the final integration, 
involving the fulfillment of the multi-core implementation.
This multi-core architecture aims to facilitate a way, in which the accelerator
functions independent of each core, and also present a form of interaction that
allows a master processor to send messages to each slave, which can use any of 
the available accelerators. To achieve this goal,
first it is analyzed the memory partitioning requirements for every processor,
to run on a single block, and the specific components selection that, at the
end, would help the accessing of accelerator interface and processor
addressing.
